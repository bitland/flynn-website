# Flynn roadmap
  
Flynn is currently unstable and not suitable for production environments.

Until Flynn is production-ready our focus is on test coverage, stability, and security. 

## Short term goals

After Flynn is ready for production development will focus on appliances for major open source databases and operator tooling, log aggregation, user ACLs, and diagnostic tools.
